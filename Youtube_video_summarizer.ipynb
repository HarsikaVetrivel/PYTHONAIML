            "Aims to introduce these techniques and not to the very detailed level of how it is implemented but at least I will show you the idea behind it so that later on you can read it and learn about all these things on your own .\n",
            " processor architecture does the same thing that you do inside the CPU . There are few registers which you know from r0 to R 31 in arm seven . CPU based on the need creates other set of registers temporary registers .\n",
            " Register renaming is called register renaming it's a technique used for some purpose let us see what is the purpose data hazards we saw that in pipeline as well as in the superscalar processor especially the scoreboarding we saw yesterday was not able to improve the performance of instruction execution .\n",
            " Because of super scalar how much we executed all of them we took some around 62 Cycles to execute all the instructions . But still we only saved four Cycles . The reason is that some instruction was not able to proceed further because there are some instruction which is trying to read from it the same register .\n",
            " Scalar architecture was built because of this data hazards can we do something so that the dependency on those data hazards is a dependency between two multiple instructions can we localize the dependency between only set of instructions . The rest of the instruction can proceed further without waiting for the result or reading to happen from the previous instructions .\n",
            " Register renaming is a technique to remove the data hazards so that instructions can be read back . Data Hazard prevented the use of the functional unit at all properly .\n",
            " register knee naming is a mechanism in which sets of programmable registers are visible to programmer . invisible registers are created that means I am not saying that it will be magically it will come into life when you are building the c . c .\n",
            " Many invisible registers are there but they are not visible to the programmer and mapping of some visible registers to them is dynamic . I can use one invisible register for R1 for some time later I may use it for R2 it depends on the usage .\n",
            " DMV started executing but it will end execution only after 40 Cycles very very long instruction . e was a dependency here because of which this instruction was not able to proceed further if you recall I told you that Cycles are like this .\n",
            " There are two adders in the system I am showing you so it can execute this instruction because the operands are free available that means nobody is writing into it so it doesn't have to wait for it . The problem is the result is to be written into effect now if rate is to read first before writing so it cannot write into the effect .\n",
            " ata hazards are there none of the instructions are proceeding further at all they are just all of them are held up . What is the use of having functional units and different implementation when you are not able to freely execute them because of the data dependency that is data Hazard now let me throw up some quiz now to wake you up okay .\n",
            " F6 is having raw dependency which we saw now what about f8 now this guy cannot write any effect until this is real that is also it has to write after it is real so it is not a raw Hazard it's a war Hazard . kay let me continue time is losing we are losing time okay .\n",
            " Register renaming can be used to overcome this now I am saying I am going to use register renaming to remove I see one thing is I'm not going to remove the hazard but I'm going to reduce the impact as I told you in traffic jam the traffic jam that is created in a particular Junction cannot be removed but I can at least try to minimize the impact of that on some other part of the City .\n",
            " Even if I do some any technique I cannot remove it that is there similarly if these two instructions are there I can't do much it has to be written by this ad instruction and I have to write into this so the registers are the only way I can convey the information between the this instruction and diabetic in a store instruction .\n",
            " Register renaming is nothing but mapping some visible registers to invisible internal registers internal registers . If I am completing a new value how does it matter whether I am using the same effect or something else why can't I use some other register don't use this now .\n",
            " Hardware is able to think like a human being and it is supposed to do it whatever is thinking and then trying to avoid that dependency now it knows that I am Computing a new value why not I remove this effect from this instruction .\n",
            " on't you don't have to know so I change it to some value t now it is not sufficient if I . change it only here because the next instruction depends on the value in f8 which is computed here so what I should do by now you should have guessed it I should make this also t imagine the CPU is going into the register set instead of f8 it is going to use T going forward .\n",
            " F8 is not Disturbed at all I have introduced a new register and this instruction is going to write into T not into f8 . I don't have to worry about this instruction completing before even even this starts executing before even this begins executing . I can now start executing this instruction which was held up because of f8 now it's freedom .\n",
            " F10 is not Disturbed but the problem is this is only 10 Cycles okay so before even this completes this fellow also can complete 10 seconds it will complete but now it wants to write into F6 now I have a problem again if I say I want to use F6 and this F6 are the same .\n",
            " I don't want this multi depend on this F6 okay I want to avoid that dependency so so that this 40 cycles of div D only blocks these two instructions and nothing at least for now nothing below .\n",
            " There may be some confusion created because I am mapping the F6 to s that means this also should become s . ew value into F6 so I can actually continue with F6 usage here but do not use F6 in these two instructions .\n",
            " Using F right I have to go down and change this also to T otherwise I will have a wrong value that you have to take care so similar thing has to be done here I am not changing it so I don't have to worry about it here .\n",
            " Register renaming has removed the look we are localized block only with this and then we are freeing up this thing so what are the advantages these instructions will be completed and new instructions can come in and they can occupy the multi multiplier or the adder .\n",
            " F I will have a previous value which was there computed by the previous instructions so we are delinqued it in fact we have removed the dependency between them so old value was in f8 new value is going to be in T .\n",
            " D be both a register or memory it's not that you have to find the temporary registers for only the registers inside the CPU you can even do it for memory instead of going into the memory and reading it you can keep it in the register .\n",
            " The first dependency the false dependency is broken and additional opportunities for outer for the execution is creators now how are we creating an additional opportunity we are allowing this to run .\n",
            " When all the reads needing the value temporary registers have been satisfied the temporary resistance created can be discarded once you okay when all the . reads are satisfied suppose it's when all . the reads needed the value in temporary registers are satisfied .\n",
            " Temporary registers can be discarded whenever I discard it . I don't need to maintain yes no longer after these two instructions are done . A processor is not going to remember there was afraid earlier effect earlier .\n",
            " S can be discarded as soon as their usage is done it was used it was required only for these two instructions and it is taken care of so why are we doing all this we are doing it because all these instructions are executed out of sequence .\n",
            " Data Hazard was there earlier I have removed it so I remove one data hazard by replacing it with f8 with a d so that the impact of this on instructions below is removed okay so it's like cutting off something okay I hope register renaming is understood by you now I will tell you how it is implemented only in one slide .\n",
            " This is for loading the data from the memory another one is storing the data into the memory so effectively I have these interfaces to the outside world this is for reading in the instructions from the instruction memory . This is to if I do a load operation I get the values on this buffers .\n",
            " Tly they have buffers now I have an option now either keep this value here and then continue to have it or I create this as a temporary registers renaming it now if I have two instructions as I told you let me explain these two instructions .\n",
            " SD instruction which may be running somewhere in the load store function unit I am not showing everything it will not read from F6 which was there it will read from this value okay see it is reading from the local register temporary register .\n",
            " Thomas solo scheme is using temporary registers which are called resistor renaming and it is using common database and the reservation stations to do the Dynamic instruction schedule links . intoma solar scheme it is reading from temporary locations which are registered renaming nothing but register renaming from reservation stations .\n",
            " Understanding this will help you know what is done inside of processors how whatever you write whatever program you write now you will remember for sure the instruction that you see the assembly instruction you generate in system programming .\n",
            " The Thomas algorithm running on that structure architecture versus what you saw yesterday scoreboarding . The algorithm which is used by the hardware is called commercials algorithm . It is a dynamic instruction scheduling scheme implementing not only what was done by scoreboarding but also registered renaming .\n",
            " There is a buffer which is called reservation station they are all waiting instructions are waiting with along with the operands for if you to take it one by one and start executing detection and execution control functionalities are distributed now .\n",
            " ystem results are directly passed to functional units from reservation station so results are passed even operands are passed from the reservation station rather than from register set . Reorder buffer is reorder buffer and speculative execution .\n",
            " ROV is called reorder buffer and serves the function of bringing completed instructions back into an order which is consistent with the program order so let me explain we started off with a sequence of instructions in a basic block that means what between this jump instruction there are some set of instructions which are to be executed in the same sequence they came into the system in the if stage and then they got issued issue into different functional units .\n",
            " Some function units do it in one cycle some take 40 seconds some take 20 Cycles you can imagine you know that so imagine if I had a instruction div Lord multiply add sub everything is one after the other they're all issued in order they're getting executed in order but they complete execution out of order .\n",
            " Instructions are getting instructions getting completed in out of sequence not in the same order they are completed . They are completed in a random fashion totally in order . Something started earlier will end later something started later will finish early .\n",
            " n I do something similar to that in the right back stage what I want to do is if I have instructions which are getting completed out of sequence I don't bother to write into the destination registers immediately but I cannot lose the value that has been computed suppose some addition was performed I have the result but I am not writing into the register destination register immediately because I want the previous one to be completed before I write the result . n\n",
            " Ch are the operands and where is the destination which register the destination actually our print also is not needed I'm sorry operands are taken care of by the other units the reservation stations .\n",
            " This program so I store the instructions in the same order in the cyclic buffer . I do it only when I have at a time suppose if it is a 10 depth of this buffer is 10 I can have 10 instructions in execution . I will commit those commitments writing into the register right back .\n",
            " If one of the instructions is holding I just don't write those results but I accumulate them . I am delaying the writing of the results into the right back more into the destination registers till all the results of the previous instructions are ready I hold it till that point .\n",
            " We are not writing into the register set immediately we are waiting for other instructions to complete . We are holding it in the immediate temporary buffer this is called ROV so if any instruction down the line wants the results of computer by the previous instruction it will take it from rovs you do not go to register set .\n",
            " Instructions are issued in order but they are not starting in the same order because some may be waiting for the operand because of that they may not start immediately even if they start they will not complete synchronously . The results are saved somewhere it is not with the functional unit anymore they are in the ROV this is the Crux of this logic .\n",
            " n the program order we have to write into them in the same order in which this instruction came then only it will look similar to what programmer wanted so how do I do it I keep it in the temporary buffer so this out of order completion results here this is the result but I need to write it in in order .\n",
            " Hardware added so that we store the results temporarily in the buffer before writing into the register set so that user does not see the correctness is Disturbed or there is a fault in it but CPU can now use the functional unit effe. gister .\n",
            " At any time program state or processor State is nothing but the register sets what is the content of them . Register set is the Master Copy that only shows the state of the processor . When there is a contact switch we need to do pending jobs whatever is there .\n",
            " processor state are defined in terms of instructions which have been committed . Only committed instructions are considered to be done other things are all we are doing it ahead but we are not going to save it let me give an example .\n",
            " College should take no gone you have to come again write those exams do whatever preparation hope you remember all that what you studied I don't remember what I thought so let us see it will be fun .\n",
            " processor state is still the register set only though we have so many register renaming business and then we have Rob all of them are there but still we are not going to save all these things because they are all not visible to the programmer .\n",
            " ROV is still very private to the CPU implementation so os does not have to know or it is not required to know these are all the integrate implementation details of the processor that is what Intel and amds are doing Windows guys Microsoft guys know how to know they do not share that information .\n",
            " The exception is something which happens because of an instruction being executed . Sometimes it is maybe even committed committed means it is returned into the register now I am saying it is not going to be Regis returning to register it is going to  written into ROV .\n",
            " R1 is not going to have this value it is only stored here saying that a subtract instruction was executed it found out some value V1 and it is supposed to go to R1 it is in ROV why it is not committed prior to this instruction DVD audio is not at over so I cannot commit it .\n",
            " Arduino class we saw register content on the Arduino studio right so admin Studio sorry what will it show it will show the register content of these instructions whatever it has stores it should show only those values it cannot show the newly computed R1 value because one reason it is still in ROV only .\n",
            " If subtract was completed prior to division R1 was written I would have written the result into R1 now if the exception happens in due R1 is not going to have the value what it was supposed to have prior to the execution of div . If you have a ROV reorder buffer this subtract result wo. ne to R1 so it cannot show so if I have a system like ROV .\n",
            " If Bim was not completed it stopped in between I will still have the value which was there prior to this execution so I can support precise exceptions I hope this is clear I am not going to explain more you have to rerun this video if you want to understand it .\n",
            " If this DB is starting late and then gets into an exception that means it got into some divide by zero error because of that it cannot continue the execution it should bring the bring it to the notice of the programmer creating an exception to the CPU and CPU will run the exception Handler .\n",
            " Hand . s not committed now you may wonder what if this instruction itself is not committed then you will have a problem no if it is in Rob you should write it and then only create this exception this this this previous instruction should have been commit committed .\n",
            " If you are able to do this then it's called precise exception support or imprecise if it is not possible and you are committing some results of the next instruction into the register set then you are disturbing it . In that case new set of instruction will come into the CPU remember this Old State what is there in Rob is all gone .\n",
            " Rob is a cyclic buffer holding instructions in the program orders the instructions are issued to relevant issues relevant issues . If this is generating an exception it's all that done after this div is forgotten only what is above is maintained in the register set these are all in Rob .\n",
            " The flag with each ROV entry is one instruction and each of those entries will have a flag to indicate whether the instruction in that position has been completed or not . If you have an entry in the rob it shows you the order in which the instructions came in .\n",
            " You are just storing it in the order in which the instructions came in actual instruction it depends on what you store . Give an example I have an instruction add F1 comma F2 comma F3 I am not storing this F2 F3 anywhere .\n",
            " Rob can hold only eight instructions in the instructions buffer ROV which is I Plus 8 . Rob says he cannot issue an instruction through any functional unit unless I create or make an entry in the table because if I don't do it I will lose the instruction in which order it came .\n",
            " It is like this when you come into the class you have to make sure that you log into the zoom and then register yourself that you are the is you know roll number . If you are so much Keen you can switch on the mobile and then keep listening to this from this mobile .\n",
            " All the results are ready all of them are ready but can I write these results into the register no because this is the first instruction came I should wait till this instruction is executed completed and the value is available . All the functional units are free except maybe this functional unit . All of them have computed the instructions and they have put the results now .\n",
            " There is no sequence any functional unit completing the instruction they can come here hey this is the result this is a register where it is supposed to go bye bye I am going to exude next instruction it will go on take the instant section start executing it .\n",
            " Lt value is copied to its destination register and the instruction is then removed from ROV . Once you commit the value you don't need to keep it in the ROV it can be removed it's like a temporary cyclic buffer .\n",
            " An instruction execution can happen only if it is present in ROV and if it wants an operand from the value which is stored in the previously completed instruction, the next unit section wants that register r10 . The value of I plus k can be used as an input operand for subsequent instruction in the ROV .\n",
            " Register the instruction operands are not always read from the register set they are either taken from the reservation station or they are taken from ROV . If they are not in these two locations that means what we are using some old value which was computed by some instruction earlier which has been committed to register set so it is available in register set .\n",
            " instruction I I plus K is completed and it has computed the value and then says it is true if it says true I I want this register value maybe register 11 and then this is the value some instruction below wants add I want some operand from R11 .\n",
            " In Rob multiple instructions which have been completed may have their results which are not yet committed to the register sets so it is equivalent to operant forwarding which we saw in pipelining . The value in Rob are simply work in progress and not reflected in the program or processor state .\n",
            " Written back of instructions are done in the original program order where the results of the instructions are written into the destination registers . for exception handling so I told you this I explained you already to enable the instruction execution okay . I hope this explanations add to what I have explained in the class now .\n",
            " Raw instruction if its input offerings are not available so what is happening is Rob also will not have all the results okay I told you that some instruction if it wants the this you know operands from the ROV you can take it . If it is not ready I cannot go to the register set and take it because this will be a stale value .\n",
            " If I don't have it from Rob it means that it is not at over I cannot proceed further so that instruction has to be stored that means it will be waiting for the operands to be available operant forwarding from ROV could speed up the execution .\n",
            " ROV only that maintains the record in such an issue and commit or in program order program and process states are correctly preserved by committing it in order it is a simpler technique to enable parallel execution along with preserving program model .\n"
